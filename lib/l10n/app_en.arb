    "paragraph1": "My adventure with programming in Flutter began in December 2022, when I came across Adam Smaki's Facebook ad. Encouraged by the opportunity to create my own mobile applications, I decided to attend a webinar. Flutter's presentation made a huge impression on me, prompting me to start learning from January 2023. The process was a source of great satisfaction for me, and I developed my skills not only through Adam's course, but also by using \"Flutter Mapp\" and \"Flutter Athletes Poland\" materials.",
    "paragraph2": "In July 2023, after six months of intensive study, I started working on my first application - \"Model Maniacs\". It is a tool created for collectors of Hot Wheels and Matchbox model cars, which I collect myself. The app, available in the Play store, is available in 7 languages and uses Firebase. Since its release on August 29, the app has received five updates, earning praise from users.",
    "paragraph3": "I then took on a project that had been on my mind for a long time - an app for 3D printer users. I've been running a small company specializing in 3D printing since 2021, which inspired me to create a tool to manage my filament inventory, printer database and print history, including filament consumption. The result of two months of work became the ALNO 3D Filaments Warehouse application, also based on Firebase and managed with Bloc Cubit.",
    "paragraph4": "I am currently working on a third application and at the same time looking for employment opportunities as a Flutter developer. My goal is to learn from professionals every day and participate in commercial projects.",
    "alno3D": "ALNO 3D is a 3D printing company and also under this brand I have released both my applications.",
